            <p>"We Become the Flowers" is a non-profit collective with the sole goal of supporting and assisting the living dead with...living.
               By providing resources, advocating for rights, and advancing the general well-being of all corpses, decaying bodies, and otherwise
               dead organisms, we provide the opportunity to not just survive, but truly thrive. "We Become the Flowers" has continuously proven to be a necessary organization. As corpses continue to be misrepresented in media,
               endure physical and emotional mistreatment around the world, and lack the respect overall respect owed to them, "We Become the Flowers" acts as a sanctuary,
               refuge, and a platform for change.
