    <h2>"This isn't anything like what my religion/science/logic/my mom told me!"</h2>
    <p>They lied. I don't know what to tell you.</p>

    <h2>Why does this organization celebrate death?</h2>
    <p>Why not? Death comes for us all.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Is living as a corpse/spirit unpleasant?</h2>
    <p>Aside from a reported crushing loneliness and permanent feeling of dread or exhaustion, it's not so bad! The smell is awful but you
    lose your sense of smell early anyways. There's also the issue of desecration and grave robbing, but you win some you lose some.
    </p>

    <h2>Do I have to live on as a corpse/spirit?</h2>
    <p>Of course not! While the process is extremely paintful (often described as the worst pain imaginable), it's possible to extinguish the soul and reach a true eternal slumber.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Can you request the extermination of another soul?</h2>
    <p>Due to previous legal issues, we cannot accept requests to extinguish another being's soul, only your own. We have very poor lawyers.</p>
